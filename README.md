Problem

Example: 

People have to go shopping often times. Some go every few days other go once every weeks. All of them tend to forget what they really want to buy. This causes buying less than needed or unnecessary purchases.


Scenario

Example: 

With the shopping list people can figure out what they really need, how much they need of this certain item, and even can calculate before hand how much they are going to spend (if they know the prices of the items they want to buy).
